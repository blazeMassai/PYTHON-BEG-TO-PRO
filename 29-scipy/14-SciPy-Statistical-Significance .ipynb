    "\n",

    "Here are some techniques and keywords that are important when performing such tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hypothesis in Statistics\n",
    "Hypothesis is an assumption about a parameter in population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Null Hypothesis\n",

    "3. Alternate Hypothesis\n",
    "It assumes that the observations are due to some reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its alternate to Null Hypothesis.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "For an assessment of a student we would take:\n",
    "\"student is worse than average\" - as a null hypothesis, and:\n",
    "\"student is better than average\" - as an alternate hypothesis."
